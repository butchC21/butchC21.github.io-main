                <p class="subtext">Unsplash used a beautiful and functional design, and it is the result of thoughtful and intentional use of white space. 
                    The space between each images creates distinction and is separated with just enough space to indicate a relationship with the text and 
                    images above and below.</p>

                <a href="https://www.generali.com/">generali.com</a>
                  <p class="subtext">Repetition is very imperative in the design of Generali website. 
                      They reused the same or similar color (red) throughout the site. 
                      I can say that this is a good design practice because it seeks to repeat some aspects 
                      of a design, creates a sense of unity, and consistency all throughout. 
                      Ultimate, they made a lasting impression.</p>

                    <h2>Proximity</h2>
                    <p>Shopee</p>
                <a href="https://shopee.ph/">shopee.ph</a>
                  <p class="subtext">Proximity is the grouping and shaping of objects in a composition. 
                      And in the design of Shopeeâ€™s website, I can say that they used this principle. 
                      As such it created and dispel connections between and among the images. 
                      The related elements were grouped together, and they were viewed as a group 
                      and the unrelated ones were distanced. Thus, it helped to differentiate visual 
                      elements to reduce visual clutter and make the website more comprehensible.</p>
